# Fundamentals II: Intro to Class-Based Program Design

This repository contains the course materials, including the class web
page, for Fundamentals II offered at Northeastern University by Sam
Tobin-Hochstadt and David Van Horn.

It depends upon the textbook and software [_Designing Programs with
Class_](https://github.com/dvanhorn/dpc/).
