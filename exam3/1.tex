\begin{problem}\pts{18} % same as on the previous exam :)

Here is a data definition for a class of objects.  It intentionally
uses meaningless names to test whether you've sufficiently
internalized the data-driven development process we've talked about
since the Fall.

\begin{verbatim}
;; A P is one of:          
;; - A                  ;; An A is a (new a% String)
;; - B                  ;; A  B is a (new b% String A)
;; - C                  ;; A  C is a (new c% P)

(define-class a% (fields w))
(define-class b% (fields x y))
(define-class c% (fields z))
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Design the following methods for \verb|P|s:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \verb|size| - the size of an \verb|A| is $5$; the size of a
  \verb|B| is $8$, regardless of what's inside; and the size of a
  \verb|C| contributes $1$ to the size of the \verb|P| inside.

\item \verb|replace-x| - produces a \verb|P| like this one, but
  with any \verb|x| field replaced by the given string.

\item \verb|same-x-and-w?| - given two strings, produce true if this
  \verb|P| contains a \verb|B| whose \verb|x| is equal to the
  first given string and whose \verb|y| is an \verb|A| whose
  \verb|w| is equal to the second given string.  Produces false
  otherwise.

\end{enumerate}

Be sure to define any interfaces you need and say which classes
implement which interfaces so that your program treats all values
according to their interface.

Here are data, class, and interface definitions for a list of numbers:
\begin{alltt}
;; An LoN is one of:
;; - (new mt%)
;; - (new cons% Number LoN)
;; and implements:
;; - sum : -> Number
;;   Compute the sum of the numbers in this list.
;; - sqrs : -> LoN
;;   List of squares of each number in this list.

(define-class mt%

  (define (sqrs) this))

(define-class cons%
  (fields first rest)
  (define (sum)
    (+ (this . first)

  (define (sqrs)
    (new cons% 
         (sqr (this . first)) ; (sqr x) = x\(\sp{2}\)
         (this . rest . sqrs))))
\end{alltt}
%
Here are some examples:
\begin{verbatim}
(check-expect ((new mt%) . sum) 0)
(check-expect ((new cons% 4 (new cons% 5 (new mt%))) . sum)  9)
(check-expect ((new mt%) . sqrs) (new mt%))
(check-expect ((new cons% 4 (new cons% 5 (new mt%))) . sqrs)
              (new cons% 16 (new cons% 25 (new mt%))))
\end{verbatim}

\newpage
\noindent
Develop the \verb|sum-sqrs| method that computes the sum of the
squares of a list of numbers.  Here is an example:
\begin{verbatim}
(check-expect ((new cons% 4 (new cons% 5 (new mt%))) . sum-sqrs) 
              (+ 16 25))
\end{verbatim}

If you can, define a super class of \verb|mt%| and \verb|cons%| and
lift the definition of \verb|sum-sqrs| to this class.  (We will assume
the appropriate \verb|super| declaration in \verb|mt%| and
\verb|cons%|.)  If you cannot, define methods in both \verb|mt%| and
\verb|cons%| for partial credit.

\begin{problem} \pts{15}

In order to manage class scheduling, the College decided that they
needed to create a new implementation of the \verb|Set| data
structure.  They went with the lowest bidder, which
turned out to be a bunch of BU students.  Now, having paid for this
code, the College needs to test it, and they turn to you.  

Unfortunately, the code the BU students produced is so convoluted that
it doesn't bear looking at.  All you have to go on is that the
\verb|Set| data structure obeys the following interface:

\begin{verbatim}
;; A Set implements:
;; - insert : String -> Set
;;   adds given string to this set, if it isn't already there
;;   (otherwise produces this set)
;; - remove : String -> Set
;;   removes given string from this set, if it's already there
;;   (otherwise produces this set)
;; - size : -> Number
;;   count the elements of this set
;; - has? : String -> Boolean
;;   is the given String in this set?

;; empty-set is a Set value containing no elements
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
\verb|Set|s should satisfy the following property, called the
``insert-size'' property, for any element and
set:

\begin{quote}
If we insert any element into any set, then the resulting set is the
same size as the original set \emph{if} the element was already in the
set, and the resulting set is one larger than the original set
if the element was \emph{not} already in the set.
\end{quote}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Codify the ``insert-size'' property as a predicate.  Write a
  test case that should pass (if the sets work right) using the
  predicate you have defined.
\end{enumerate}

\ifrubric\else
\newpage
[Here is some more space for the previous problem.]
\fi

\newpage
\noindent
The College wants to be really sure that their sets are correct, and
they've come up with another property that they think is true, called
the ``insert-remove'' property:

\begin{quote}
If we insert element any element $a$ into any set, and then remove any
element $b$ from the resulting set, the result has the same size as if
we do the two operations in the reverse order, i.e., remove $b$, then
insert $a$.
\end{quote}

\noindent
The College is considering adding this to the test suite as well.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}

\item Codify this property as a predicate, and write a test case that
  should pass using the predicate.

\item Is the ``insert-remove'' property true for all sets?  If so,
  give an explanation.  If not, write a counter-example (i.e., a
  failing test case) using your predicate.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
\begin{verbatim}
;; [1 pt -- contract & purpose]

(define-class file% (fields name size))

Your job is to implement one of the main tasks of the common Unix
utility \verb|find|, which gives a list of all the files within an
element.  To do so, add a \verb|list-files| method of \verb|Elem|
which produces a list of files.  So for example, we expect:
\begin{verbatim}
(check-expect (User/ . list-files) 
              (new cons% a (new cons% b (new cons% c mt))))

\begin{problem} \pts{18}
Last night, Asumu was up late improving the {\tt class} languages.
Unfortunately, he was too tired to test his work, and his last commit
broke the numeric system.
%
This puts us in the dire position of no longer being able to calculate
the factorial of large numbers, and we turn to you for help.

This is the definition of a class of functional objects
with a {\tt fact} method:

\begin{verbatim}
;; A Fact is (new fact%) and implements 
;; - fact : Natural -> Natural
;;   Compute n!.
(define-class fact%
  (define (fact n)
    (cond [(zero? n) 1]
          [else (* n (this . fact (sub1 n)))])))

(check-expect ((new fact%) . fact 0) 1)
(check-expect ((new fact%) . fact 5) 120)
\end{verbatim}

Since we can no longer rely on built in numbers to represent
\verb|Natural|s, we will represent \verb|Natural|s with objects and
then rewrite the \verb|fact| method to operate over this new kind of
data.

Here is the \verb|Natural| interface:

\begin{verbatim}
;; A Natural implements:
;; - zero? : -> Boolean
;;   is this Natural the zero value?
;; - sub1 : -> Natural
;;   produce a natural one less than this natural 
;;   (or zero if this natural is zero)
;; - times : Natural -> Natural
;;   multiply this natural by the given natural
\end{verbatim}

\newpage
Write a new definition of the \verb|fact| method using the
\verb|Natural| interface definition given above, and \emph{not} using
the built-in numbers of the class system or DrRacket.  You can assume
there is a defined constant \verb|one|, which is a \verb|Natural|
object representing $1$.

\begin{verbatim}
(check-expect ((new fact%) . fact one) one)
(check-expect ((new fact%) . fact (one . sub1)) one)
\end{verbatim}

\newpage

Now, design data and class defintions that implement \verb|Natural|, and
supports the methods \verb|zero?|, \verb|sub1|, and \verb|times|.
Define the constant \verb|one|.  (\emph{Hint}: remember that the
natural numbers can be seen as a recursive union; a natural number is
either zero, or one more than a natural number.)

It will be helpful to define the helper methods \verb|add1| and
\verb|plus|.  Also, remember that $n + m = (n-1) + m + 1$ and that $n
\cdot m = (n-1) \cdot m + n$.  Don't overlook the slightly weird
specification for \verb|sub1|: $0-1 = 0$; this weirdness is common
amongst mathematicians when working with natural numbers.

\textbf{Extra Credit}
\\
\noindent
After Van Horn discovered the problems with numbers, he attempted to
fix them.  Unfortunately, not only did he not fix them, he broke
booleans as well.  Fortunately, we have an idea about how you can
help, expressed in the following interface definitions.  

\begin{verbatim}
;; A Bool implements:
;; - branch : [Action X] [Action X] -> X
;;   run the first action if this bool is true, 
;;   otherwise run the second action

;; An [Action X] implements:
;; - run : -> X
;; run this action


\end{verbatim}

Following these interface definitions, design data and class
defintions for implementations of the \verb|Bool| interface, and
reimplement the \verb|fact| method to use them.
You will need to provide new defintions for \verb|true| and
\verb|false|, since they were broken by this catastrophe as well.
