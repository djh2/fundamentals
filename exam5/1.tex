\begin{problem} \pts{15}

% Set/Property problem

In order to manage the distribution of ID , the College decided that they
needed to create a new implementation of the \verb|Set| data
structure.  They went with the lowest bidder, which
turned out to be a bunch of BU students.  Now, having paid for this
code, the College needs to test it, and they turn to you.  

Unfortunately, the code the BU students produced is so convoluted that
it doesn't bear looking at.  All you have to go on is that the
\verb|Set| data structure obeys the following interface:

\begin{verbatim}
;; A Set implements:
;; - insert : String -> Set
;;   adds given string to this set, if it isn't already there
;;   (otherwise produces this set)
;; - remove : String -> Set
;;   removes given string from this set, if it's already there
;;   (otherwise produces this set)
;; - size : -> Number
;;   count the elements of this set
;; - has? : String -> Boolean
;;   is the given String in this set?

;; empty-set is a Set value containing no elements
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
\verb|Set|s should satisfy the following property, called the
``insert-size'' property, for any element and
set:

\begin{quote}
If we insert any element into any set, then the resulting set is the
same size as the original set \emph{if} the element was already in the
set, and the resulting set is one larger than the original set
if the element was \emph{not} already in the set.
\end{quote}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Codify the ``insert-size'' property as a predicate.  Write a
  test case that should pass (if the sets work right) using the
  predicate you have defined.
\end{enumerate}

\ifrubric\else
\newpage
[Here is some more space for the previous problem.]
\fi

\newpage
\noindent
The College wants to be really sure that their sets are correct, and
they've come up with another property that they think is true, called
the ``insert-remove'' property:

\begin{quote}
If we insert element any element $a$ into any set, and then remove any
element $b$ from the resulting set, the result has the same size as if
we do the two operations in the reverse order, i.e., remove $b$, then
insert $a$.
\end{quote}

\noindent
The College is considering adding this to the test suite as well.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}

\item Codify this property as a predicate, and write a test case that
  should pass using the predicate.

\item Is the ``insert-remove'' property true for all sets?  If so,
  give an explanation.  If not, write a counter-example (i.e., a
  failing test case) using your predicate.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
\begin{alltt}
\rubricpts{1 pt -- contract & purpose}
;; check-insert-size : Set String -> Boolean
;; check the "insert-size" property on s and i.
\rubricpts{4 pts -- code}
(define (check-insert-size s i)

% JSON problem

Here are data and class definitions for representing the files and
directories of a computer:

\begin{verbatim}
;; An Elem is one of
;; - (new file% String Number)
;; - (new dir% String LoElem)
(define-class file% (fields name size))
(define-class dir% (fields name elems))

;; A LoElem is one of
;; - (new mt%)
;; - (new cons% Elem LoElem)
(define-class mt%)
(define-class cons% (fields first rest))    
\end{verbatim}


\noindent
Here is an example of a directory tree and its representation as an
\verb|Elem|:
\begin{verbatim}
#|
 User
   +-- A
   |   +-- a.txt
   |   +-- B
   |       +-- b.rkt
   +-- C
       +-- c.c
|#

(define mt (new mt%))
(define a (new file% "a.txt" 5))
(define b (new file% "b.rkt" 10))
(define c (new file% "c.c" 1000))

(define C/ (new dir% "C" (new cons% c mt)))
(define B/ (new dir% "B" (new cons% b mt)))
(define A/ (new dir% "A" (new cons% a (new cons% B/ mt))))
(define User/ (new dir% "/" (new cons% A/ (new cons% C/ mt))))
\end{verbatim}

\newpage
\noindent
Your job is to implement one of the main tasks of the common Unix
utility \verb|find|, which gives a list of all the files within an
element.  To do so, add a \verb|list-files| method of \verb|Elem|
which produces a list of files.  So for example, we expect:
\begin{verbatim}
(check-expect (User/ . list-files) 
              (new cons% a (new cons% b (new cons% c mt))))
\end{verbatim}
\emph{Hint}: it may come in handy to be able to concatenate two
\verb|LoElem| together.

\begin{problem}\pts{5}

% Visitor on Binary Trees

\textbf{Extra Credit}
\\
\noindent
After Van Horn discovered the problems with numbers, he attempted to
fix them.  Unfortunately, not only did he not fix them, he broke
booleans as well.  Fortunately, we have an idea about how you can
help, expressed in the following interface definitions.  

\begin{verbatim}
;; A Bool implements:
;; - branch : [Action X] [Action X] -> X
;;   run the first action if this bool is true, 
;;   otherwise run the second action

;; An [Action X] implements:
;; - run : -> X
;; run this action


\end{verbatim}

Following these interface definitions, design data and class
defintions for implementations of the \verb|Bool| interface, and
reimplement the \verb|fact| method to use them.
You will need to provide new defintions for \verb|true| and
\verb|false|, since they were broken by this catastrophe as well.
