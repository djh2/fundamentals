These are notes relevant to running the course again.

Negotiate with chair to get a kick-back in to foundation account.

Biggest take-away: the original design was WAAAAAAY too ambitous about
what and how much could be covered.

Every exercise needs to be pared down.

In the beginning, you've got to drill drill drill.

Exercise 2: smiley should be two exercises.  Part I is up to pinholes.
Part II is after pinholes.

There needs to be 1-2 more exercises between 1 and 2 that drill on
expressions and syntax.

Need to do the "circles of evaluation" thing to teach people syntax.

Need to have clearer requirements about computing equipment.

People should buy the book if the exams are going to be open notes.

Fewer exams.

Daily exercises are good, but they should be much shorter.

Need to talk about the expectations of a college course: you are
responsible for staying up on the reading.  The reading should be done
*before* lecture so that lecture is not the first time you're seeing
something.  Active reading.  Reach out when lost or stuck.  (Go to the
bathroom when you need to; no need to ask or wait.)  *READ* the
syllabus and schedule.  Refer back to it frequently.  Follow
instructions precisely.

Some students (a small number) are on top of the material and would've
been able to manage the original pace.  For them it's important to
have supplemental material that can keep them occupied.

Turn lab 4 (line editor) into a homework exercise.  Give function for
rendering.


Drills on the stepper: based on the exam, it's clear people are not
internalizing the stepper.  Many student can't parse the program or
stepping produces syntax errors.  Need to really drill this.  Should
have very explicitly described rules for (1) finding the next redex,
(2) performing reduction.  This would serve 131A too.  Start when we
in arithmetic (arith, const) and add as things are introduced (plug,
cond, ...).

Maybe swap Oobleck and Files and Directories labs so that people have
more practice with (intrepretation-free) templates before seeing the
file system lab.  Could also try to make ForD lab more fun by picking
a different domain.  Maybe a photo library?  Photo or Album, etc.
Make a slideshow program.

Need some GIFs for Hangman lab, Space Invader lab, and Snek
assignment.
