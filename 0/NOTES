These are notes relevant to running the course again.

Negotiate with chair to get a kick-back in to foundation account.

Biggest take-away: the original design was WAAAAAAY too ambitous about
what and how much could be covered.

Every exercise needs to be pared down.

In the beginning, you've got to drill drill drill.

Exercise 2: smiley should be two exercises.  Part I is up to pinholes.
Part II is after pinholes.

There needs to be 1-2 more exercises between 1 and 2 that drill on
expressions and syntax.

Need to do the "circles of evaluation" thing to teach people syntax.

Need to have clearer requirements about computing equipment.

People should buy the book if the exams are going to be open notes.

Fewer exams.

Daily exercises are good, but they should be much shorter.

Need to talk about the expectations of a college course: you are
responsible for staying up on the reading.  The reading should be done
*before* lecture so that lecture is not the first time you're seeing
something.  Active reading.  Reach out when lost or stuck.  (Go to the
bathroom when you need to; no need to ask or wait.)  *READ* the
syllabus and schedule.  Refer back to it frequently.  Follow
instructions precisely.

Some students (a small number) are on top of the material and would've
been able to manage the original pace.  For them it's important to
have supplemental material that can keep them occupied.

Turn lab 4 (line editor) into a homework exercise.  Give function for
rendering.
