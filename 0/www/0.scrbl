@title[#:style accessible @courseno]{: Make Your Own Video Games: An Introduction to Programming and Computing}

@emph{Summer, July 7-26 @year}

@margin-note{A @link["https://oes.umd.edu/middle-high-school-students/terp-young-scholars"]{Terp Young Scholars} course.}



@;{
@margin-note*{@emph{Program design} is the study of systematic
thought, planning, and universally useful problem-solving skills
applied in the setting of programming and computation.}

@courseno is an introduction to computing and programming. Its major
goal is to introduce students to the principles of systematic problem
solving through programming and the basic rules of computation.

@margin-note*{@bold{Caveat:} Note that @courseno is being offered on
a trial basis as an alternative introductory course sequence.  If you
take @courseno you @emph{must} take CMSC 132A as a subsequent course.
This course @emph{will not} prepare you for the traditional CMSC 132
(no "A") course.  However, students who complete the 131A-132A
sequence will be fully prepared for all subsequent courses that list
131-132 as prerequisites.}

By the end of the course, majors in computer science will have a sense
for difference between a programmer and a well-trained software
developer. Students from all majors will have a sense of the
complexities involved in developing solid software (highly useful in
case they ever collaborate with such professionals) and they ought to
be able to use the principles of programming to solve many
non-computational problems in a systematic manner.

Masterful programmers design programs the way Jacques Pépin makes an
omellete: with systematic technique, honed creativity, and a strong
aesthetic (``There's the Wrong Way and Jacques Pépin’s Way,''
@hyperlink["http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/dining/jacques-pepin-demonstrates-cooking-techniques.html"]{New
York Times, Oct. 18, 2011}).

This course exposes students to the fundamental techniques of program
design: ``an approach to the creation of software that relies on
systematic thought, planning, and understanding from the very
beginning, at every stage and for every step''
(@hyperlink["https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/part_preface.html"]{HtDP/2e,
Preface}).  While taking this course will @emph{not} make you a great
programmer, you cannot become a great programmer without mastering
these skills.  More importantly, even if you never program again, a
student of design ``will still pick up universally useful
problem-solving skills, experience a deeply creative activity, and
learn to appreciate a new form of aesthetic.''



@bold{Assumptions:} The course does @emph{not} assume @emph{any} prior
programming experience. It is therefore suitable for all freshman
students---majors and non-majors alike---who wish to explore the
intellectual ideas of the discipline. It does assume familiarity with
(high school) arithmetic and algebra, and it demands curiosity,
self-discipline, and willingness to work with others.

subject to change until the start of the semester.
