@section{Oveview}

@elem[#:style float-right]{@result[SMILEY]}

The goal of these exercises is to use the ``arithmetic of images,'' as
provided by the @racketmodname[2htdp/image] library, to construct an
image that looks like the iconic
@link["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiley"]{Smiley}, ``a stylized
representation of a smiling humanoid face that is a part of popular
culture worldwide.''

An example of the desired result is given to the right.


This problem can be broken into two sub-problems:
@itemlist[
@item{construct elements of the smiley (head, eyes, smile)}
@item{compose those elements to create a smiley}
]

Note: You're solution doesn't have to be identical to this one, but it
should have all the same essential elements arranged in a similar
manner.  Your solution should also not involve any copy/pasted images.
Everything should be constructed using the operations of
@racketmodname[2htdp/image].

@section{Deconstructing happiness}


Before you begin, open a DrRacket window and @bold{actively
read} the documentation for @racket[circle], @racket[ellipse],
@racket[rectangle], @racket[beside], @racket[overlay],
@racket[image-height], @racket[image-width], and @racket[crop].

@margin-note{Actively read means more than just reading; it means
reading, writing examples, playing, and experimenting as you go.}

The smiley consists of a few distinct parts:

@(define-syntax-rule (result e) 
   @examples[#:eval the-eval #:result-only e])

@itemlist[
@item{the head: @result[HEAD]}
@item{the eyes: @result[EYES]}
@item{the smile: @result[SMILE]}
]

Some of these parts can in turn are constructed out of
futher subparts: 
@itemlist[
@item{the eyes consist of two eyes (with space between
them): @result[EYE]}
@item{the smile can be constructed from two circles, overlaying them, and taking the bottom half:
@result[(circle (* 9/10 SMILE-RADIUS) "solid" "gold")]
@result[(circle SMILE-RADIUS "solid" "black")]
@result[(overlay (circle (* 9/10 SMILE-RADIUS) "solid" "gold") (circle SMILE-RADIUS "solid" "black"))]
}
]

@exercise["Simple images"]{

Using @racket[circle], @racket[ellipse], and @racket[overlay], write
expressions that produce images that look like each of the following:

@result[EYE], @result[HEAD], @result[SMILE-YELLOW-CIRCLE], @result[SMILE-BLACK-CIRCLE],
and @result[(overlay SMILE-YELLOW-CIRCLE SMILE-BLACK-CIRCLE)].

}

@exercise["Image helper functions"]{

To help construct these images, complete the following helper function
definitions, which have been stubbed for you:

@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #false]|{
#lang racket
;; hspace : Number -> Image
;; Create given amount of horizontal space as an image
(check-expect (hspace 10) (rectangle 10 0 "solid" "black"))
(define (hspace x) 
  empty-image) ; stub

;; bottom-half : Image -> Image
;; Crop an image to just it's bottom half
(check-expect (bottom-half (rectangle 100 60 "solid" "red"))
              (rectangle 100 30 "solid" "red"))
(define (bottom-half i) 
  i) ; stub
}|

}


Now write expressions that produce each of the images show in this lab
write-up.  You may find @racket[hspace] and @racket[bottom-half]
useful.

@exercise[@elem{@racket[HEAD], @racket[EYES], and @racket[SMILE]}]{

Give three definitions that correctly define the head, eyes, and smile
images:

@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #false]|{
#lang racket
(define HEAD ...)
(define EYES ...)
(define SMILE ...)
}|
}

@exercise[@racket[RADIUS]]{

Define a constant @racket[RADIUS], which determines the radius
of the smiley face.  Reformulate the definitions of @racket[HEAD],
@racket[EYES], and @racket[SMILE] in terms of @racket[RADIUS].

Use the following proportions to calculate the sizes of the other
images:

@itemlist[

@item{The eyes should have a height of 2/3 * @racket[RADIUS],
width of 1/3 * @racket[RADIUS], and space of 1/3 *
@racket[RADIUS] between them.}

@item{The smile should be constructed from a black circle that has a
radius of 8/10 * @racket[RADIUS] and a yellow circle that is 9/10
of that quantity.}
]

Make sure that changing the value of @racket[RADIUS] doesn't
break your program and produces a smiley image that is consistently
scaled up or down.
}

Experiment with different values for @racket[RADIUS] and observe the
results.


@section{Dancing on a pinhole}

Now it's time to put the pieces together.

You have already seen how to compose images using operations like
@racket[above], @racket[beside], and @racket[overlay], but to
construct the smiley, you'll need more fine-grained control of where
the peices line up.

@elem[#:style float-right]{@result[PH-SMILEY]}

The image on the right is the smiley with some guide lines added.
Notice that the eyes and smile are centered horizontally.  Vertically,
the middle of the head is aligned with the top of the smile and bottom
of the eyes.

To easily align these images in this way we can use
@racketmodname[2htdp/image]'s notion of a @emph{pinhole}.

Actively read the documentation for @racket[put-pinhole],
@racket[center-pinhole], @racket[clear-pinhole], and
@racket[overlay/pinhole].

@exercise["Pinhole helpers"]{

To help align images, complete the following helper function
definitions, which have been stubbed for you:

@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #false]|{
#lang racket
;; center-top-pinhole : Image -> Image
;; Put pinhole halfway across and at top of given image
(check-expect (center-top-pinhole HEAD)
              (put-pinhole RADIUS 0 HEAD))
(define (center-top-pinhole i)
  i) ; stub

;; center-bottom-pinhole : Image -> Image
;; Put pinhole halfway across and at bottom of given image
(check-expect (center-bottom-pinhole HEAD)
              (put-pinhole RADIUS (* 2 RADIUS) HEAD))
(define (center-bottom-pinhole i)
  i) ; stub
}|
}

Experiment with your helper functions and built-in pinhole operations
to produce each of the following images:

@result[(center-pinhole EYES)], 
@result[(center-bottom-pinhole EYES)],  
@result[(center-top-pinhole EYES)], 
@result[(center-pinhole SMILE)],  
@result[(center-bottom-pinhole SMILE)], 
@result[(center-top-pinhole SMILE)],  
@result[
(overlay/pinhole (center-bottom-pinhole EYES) (center-top-pinhole SMILE))], 
@result[
(overlay/pinhole (center-pinhole EYES) (center-top-pinhole SMILE))], 
@result[
(overlay/pinhole (center-top-pinhole EYES) (center-top-pinhole SMILE))], 
and
@result[
(overlay/pinhole (center-top-pinhole EYES) (center-bottom-pinhole SMILE))].

@exercise[@racket[SMILEY]]{

Write an expression that produces the smiley image and define the
constant @racket[SMILEY] to refer to it.
@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #false]|{
#lang racket
(define SMILEY ...)
}|

@examples[
  #:eval the-eval
  SMILEY
]
}


@section{All the Smileys}

Congratulations!  You've solved one instance of the Smiley problem.
But suppose you wanted to produce two or more Smileys, each with a
different radius? For example, maybe you want to make something like
this:

@result[
(apply beside (map smiley '(10 20 40 80 160)))
]

In some sense, you have a solution to this problem: you can edit the
definition of @racket[RADIUS] and run the program to produce each of
the Smileys involved in the image above.  The problem with this
solution is you need many programs to solve an instance of the
problem. 

A much better solution would be to have a single program that solves
@bold{any} instance of the problem.  To do this, you need a
@emph{function} that can compute a Smiley image @emph{in terms of some
given value for the radius}.

@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #false]|{
#lang racket
;; smiley : Number -> Image
;; Construct a Smiley of given radius
}|

@examples[
  #:eval the-eval
  (smiley 20)
  (smiley 40)
  (smiley 80)
]

Of course, solving this generalization of the Smiley problem should
also solve the particular instance of creating a Smiley of radius
@racket[RADIUS]:

@examples[
  #:eval the-eval
  (smiley RADIUS)
  SMILEY
]

The definition of @racket[smiley] is going to be very similar to the
definition of @racket[SMILEY].  In fact, you could start from the
following stub:

@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #false]|{
#lang racket
;; smiley : Number -> Image
;; Construct a Smiley of given radius
(define (smiley r)
  SMILEY) ; stub
}|

The definition, like a broken clock, is sometimes right!  In
particular, @racket[(smiley RADIUS)] produces the correct result, but
every other input does not.

To see, take a look at your definition of @racket[SMILEY], which
should involve uses of the constants @racket[RADIUS], @racket[HEAD],
@racket[EYES], and @racket[SMILE]:

@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #false]|{
#lang racket
(define SMILEY 
  (... RADIUS ... HEAD ... EYES ... SMILE ...))
}|

Take the right hand side of this definition and replace
@racket[SMILEY] in the definition of @racket[smiley]:

@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #false]|{
#lang racket
;; smiley : Number -> Image
;; Construct a Smiley of given radius
(define (smiley r)
  (... RADIUS ... HEAD ... EYES ... SMILE ...))
}|

Looking at this sketch of the code, it should be clear we want to
compute things in terms of @racket[r] in place of the constant
@racket[RADIUS].  The constants @racket[HEAD], @racket[EYES], and
@racket[SMILE] are also defined in terms of the constant
@racket[RADIUS], so want to develop functions:

@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #false]|{
#lang racket
;; head : Number -> Image
;; Construct a head image for a Smiley of given radius
(define (head r)
  HEAD) ; stub

;; eyes : Number -> Image
;; Construct an eyes image for a Smiley of given radius
(define (eyes r)
  EYES) ; stub

;; smile : Number -> Image
;; Construct a smile image for a Smiley of given radius
(define (smile r)
  SMILE) ; stub
}|

The correct code for @racket[smiley] can now be obtained by replacing
@racket[RADIUS] with @racket[r], and @racket[HEAD] with @racket[(head
r)], etc.:

@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #false]|{
#lang racket
(define (smiley r)
  (... r ... (head r) ... (eyes r) ... (smile r) ...))
}|

You should be able to follow a similar process to obtain correct
definitions of @racket[head], @racket[eyes], and @racket[smile].  For
example, in the case of @racket[head], replace @racket[HEAD] with its
definition:

@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #false]|{
#lang racket
(define (head r)
  (... RADIUS ...))
}|

And replace @racket[RADIUS] with @racket[r]:

@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #false]|{
#lang racket
(define (head r)
  (... r ...))
}|

You can check your work by comparing against known solutions:

@examples[
  #:eval the-eval
  (head RADIUS)
  HEAD
  (eyes RADIUS)
  EYES
  (smile RADIUS)
  SMILE
  (smiley RADIUS)
  SMILEY
]

And you can cofirm it still works when the radius varies:

@examples[
  #:eval the-eval
  (head 20)
  (head 40)
  (eyes 20)
  (eyes 40)
  (smile 20)
  (smile 40)
  (smiley 20)
  (smiley 40)
]

Having a function makes it easy to write programs that construct
several Smileys of varying sizes:

@examples[
  #:eval the-eval
  (beside (smiley 20) (smiley 40) (smiley 80))]
