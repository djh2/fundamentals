This video demonstrates how to download and install DrRacket, the
programming environment used throughout this course.

I'll demonstrate installing DrRacket on a Mac system, but the steps
are similar on Windows and Linux.

To begin, make sure you're connected to the internet and open a web
browser.

(pause)

Navigate to racket-lang.org.

(pause)

Follow the Download link.

This brings you to a page tailored to your operating system and the
current version of Racket.

If you need an installer for a different operating system, select it
from the drop-down menu.

If you need a different version of Racket, follow the "All Versions"
link.

Since I want the latest version for Mac, I click the installer link.

It may take a few minutes to download depending on your internet
connection.  After the download is complete, open the file.

(pause)

Copy the Racket folder into your Applications folder.

Once copied, navigate to the Applications folder and launch the
DrRacket program like you would any other application.

The first time you run DrRacket, you may be prompted to confirm that
you want to run a program downloaded from the internet.  Press Open.

You should see a short splash screen, after which the main DrRacket
window is displayed.

DrRacket is a programming environment for several different
prorgramming languages and you will need to choose a particular
language before you get started.

Select the menu from the bottom left corner that say "No Language
Chosen" and select "Choose Language".

We will be using the Teaching Langauge: Beginning Student.  Select
this option and press OK.

A Run button will appear in the top right corner of the window.

Press Run to activate the Beginning Student Language.  Notice DrRacket
now displays "Beggining Student" in the lower pane of the window.

You can now exit DrRacket; there is no need to save this file.

At this point DrRacket is installed.  We can close these folders
and eject the installer disk.

To return to DrRacket, launch like you would any other application.

DrRacket will remember your language selection and start ready to
develop Beginning Student programs.

Subsequent videoes will show how to actually use DrRacket to develop
programs.
