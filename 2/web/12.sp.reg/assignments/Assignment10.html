<h1>CS 2510 Spring 2012:Assignment  10 - Loops</h1>


<h4>Practice Problems</h4>

<p>Work out the following exercises. Do not add it
to your assignment submission, though you should keep it in your
electronic portfolio in your own <em>svn</em> repository.</p> 

<p><strong>Problem: Using ArrayList</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Finish the <em>SelectionSort</em> problem from Lab 10.</p/</li>
  <li><p>In the <tt>Algorithms</tt> class design the method
  <tt>evenItems</tt> that consumes an <tt>ArrayList</tt> and produces
  a new one that contains only the items that were at the
  even-numbered locations.</p></li>
  <li><p>In the <tt>Algorithms</tt> class design the method
  <tt>lower</tt> that consumes an <tt>ArrayList</tt>, a
  <tt>Comparator</tt>, and an object of the type <tt>T</tt> and produces
  a new one <tt>ArrayList</tt> that contains only those items from the
  original one that come before the given one according to the
  ordering defined by the given <tt>Comparator</tt>.</p></li>
  <li><p><p>In the <tt>Algorithms</tt> class design the method
  <tt>upper</tt> that consumes an <tt>ArrayList</tt>, a
  <tt>Comparator</tt>, and an object of the type <tt>T</tt> and produces
  a new one <tt>ArrayList</tt> that contains only those items from the
  original one that come after the given one according to the
  ordering defined by the given <tt>Comparator</tt>.</p></li>

</ol>

<h4>Pair Programming Assignment</h4>

<p>These problems should be checked into your pair's SVN repository
by the due date.</p>

<p><strong>Project naming requirements</strong></p>
<p>The names of the projects and some of the project files must be
exactly the same as specified in the assignment. Failure to do so
makes it impossible for the graders to run your submission and results
in immediate <strong>loss of at least 50%</strong> of the homework
credit.</p>

<p>Every file you submit must have a header that identifies you and
the problem it solves. So, for the first problem the header should
look like this:</p>

<pre>
// Assignment 10 Problem 1
// Partner Name1
// partner1username
// Partner Name2
// partner2username
// 27 March 2012
</pre>



<h3>Problem 1 Secret Code</h3>


<p>Create a project with the name <tt>HW09Problem1</tt>.</p>

<p>You goal is to write a program that will encode and decode secret
messages using a simple mapping of letters to a permutation of all
letters. So if our alphabet had only five letters (a, b, c, d, and e)
we could choose to encode them as (b, e, a, c, and d). Then the received
message 'abe edc' would be decoded as 'cab bed' and the message 'bad
ace' would be sent encoded as 'ebc bad'.</p>

<p>Download the file <a
href="PermutationCode.java">PermutationCode.java</a>. It is a skeleton
for your program. Your job is to fill design the three
methods  for which the purpose statements and the headers are already
provided. Of course, you may need additional helper methods, and, of
course, you will still follow the <em>design recipe</em>.</p>

<p>The class <tt>PermutationCode</tt> contains the key for the
encoding and decoding of the messages, as well as the methods that
perform these tasks. There are two constructors. One allows you to
specify explicitly what will be your encoding permutation. This allows
you to test your methods that encode and decode the messages. The
second constructor generates a new encoding permutation that may be
given to the parties that wish to communicate in secret.</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Design the method <tt>encode</tt> That will consume the encoded
  message and use the <tt>ArrayList code</tt> to decipher the message,
  one character at a time. Look up methods you may use with the data of
  the type <tt>String</tt> in the Java documentation.
  </p></li>
  
<li><p>Design the method <tt>decode</tt> That will consume the message
  we wish to encode and use the <tt>ArrayList code</tt> to produce the
  encoded message, - again - 
  one character at a time.
  </p></li>
  
<li><p>Design the method <tt>initEncoder</tt> that produces a random
  permutation of the 26 letters of the alphabet and returns it as an
  <tt>ArrayList</tt> of <tt>Character</tt>s.<p>

  <p><em>Hint:</em> Make a copy of the alphabet list, then remove one
  character at random and add it to the encoder list, until all
  letters have been consumed.</p>
  </p></li>

</ol>

<h3>Problem 2 Insertion Sort</h3>


<p>Create a project with the name <tt>HW09Problem2</tt>.</p>

We have seen the recursively defined <em>insertion sort</em> algorithm
both in the first semester and also recently, using the recursively
defined lists in Java.

The main idea behind the insertion sort was that each new item has
been inserted into the already sorted list. We can modify this as
follows:

<ol>

<li><p>Design the method <tt>sortedInsert</tt> that consumes a sorted
  <tt>ArrayList<T></tt> a <tt>Comparator<T></tt> that has been used
  to define the sorted order for the given list, and an item of the
  type <tt>T</tt>. It modifies the given <tt>ArrayList<T></tt> by
  adding the given item to the <tt>ArrayList<T></tt>, preserving the
  ordering.</p>

  <p><em>Note:</em> Be careful to make sure it works correctly when the
  given <tt>ArrayList</tt> is empty, and when the item is inserted
  at the and of the <tt>ArrayList</tt>. </p></li>

<li><p>Design the method <tt>insertionSort</tt> that consumes an
  arbitrary (unsorted) <tt>ArrayList<T></tt> and a
  <tt>Comparator<T></tt> and produces a new sorted
  <tt>ArrayList<T></tt> as follows:</p>

  <p>It starts with an empty sorted list and inserts into it one by one
  all the elements of the given  <tt>ArrayList<T></tt>.</p>

  <p><em>Note:</em> It is a bit more difficult to define the insertion sort
  algorithm so that it mutates the existing <tt>ArrayList</tt>
  <em>in place</em>. </p></li>

<li><p>Design an in-place <tt>insertionSort</tt>
  method. You will get the credit only if the design is neat and
  clearly organized.</li>

<li><p>Test your code on <tt>ArrayList</tt>s with elements of the type
  <tt>String</tt> and with elements of the type <tt>Integer</tt>.</p?</li>
</ol>




<h3>Problem 3 Eliza</h3>

<p>Create a project with the name <tt>HW09Problem3</tt>.</p>

<p>Our goal is to train our computer to be a mock psychiatrist, carrying on a
conversation with a patient. The patient (the user) asks a series of questions.
The computer-psychiatrist replies to each question as follows. If the
question starts with one of the following (key)words: <em>Why, Who, How,
Where, When,</em> and <em>What</em>, the computer selects one of the three (or more)
possible answers appropriate for that question. If the first word is none of
these words the computer replies <em>I do not know</em> or <em>Why do
you want to know?</em> or something like that.</p>

<p>The file <a href="Interactions.java">Interactions.java</a> contains the code that will run
your game, once you design it.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start by designing the class <tt>Reply</tt> that holds a keyword for a question,
and an <tt>ArrayList</tt> of answers to a the question that starts with
this keyword.</p></li>

<li><p>Design the method <tt>randomAnswer</tt> for the class <tt>Reply</tt> that produces
one of the possible answers each time it is invoked. Make sure
it works fine even if you add new answers to your database later.
Make at least three answers to each question</p></li>

<li><p>Design the class <tt>Eliza</tt> that contains an <tt>ArrayList</tt> of <tt>Reply</tt>s.</p></li>

<li><p>In the class <tt>Eliza</tt> design the helper method firstWord that consumes
a <tt>String</tt> and produces the first word in the <tt>String</tt>.
The following code reads the next input line from the user. You will
need to find out what was the first word in the patient's question.
Look up the documentation for the <tt>String</tt> class (and we gently hint
that the methods <tt>trim</tt>, <tt>toLowerCase</tt>, and <tt>startsWith</tt> may be
relevant).</p>

<pre>
System.out.println("Type in a question: ");
s = input.nextLine();
</pre>

<p>Make sure your program works if the user uses all uppercase letters,
all lower case letter, mixes them up, etc.</p></li>
