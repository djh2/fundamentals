<h2>Final Project Presentations</h2>
<body>

<strong>General Comments</strong>

<p>The final project presentations will all be held in the 212 WVH
lab during the scheduled lab times on Tuesday, April 18th and during
the scheduled lecture times Wednesday, April 19st, with some
additional times on Tuesday, April 18th (9:00 - 4:00 pm) to make sure
there is enough time for everyone to 
present. Attending the presentation will 
allow you to see different programming styles, hear the comments of
the instructors about the project design and implementation, will give
you an opportunity to comment on your peer's projects, and will show
you the breadth of ways how projects of this three different types can
be designed. You should all attend your lab, your
lecture, and if you sign up for one of the extra time slots, attend
the entire time slot. You are welcome to attend any other time slots
to see what your peers have done.</p> 

<p>Please, <strong>read carefully</strong> the instructions for what
materials to prepare for the presentation, how to set up before the
presentation, and how your presentation should be organized.</p>

<strong>Project Documentation</strong>

<p>The documentation for your project should consist of the following
three parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>User's Guide:</strong> This should be a short (one page
  or so) description of what your project does and how to 'play
  the game' or 'run the application'. You should include one snapshot
  of the game/project in progress, or a transcript of the console, if the
  program uses only console for user interactions.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Design Overview:</strong> This document is for a
  programmer who may be asked to modify your program three months from
  now. It should include a class diagram (hand sketch neatly done is
  OK) and a brief description of the classes in the project and their
  role. <em>To check if you document is effective you may show it to
  another student who does not know about your project and see if they
  can understand your design from reading it.</em></li>
  
  <li><strong>Javadocs</strong> The entire project should be
  documented using the <em>Javadoc</em> style. You should then run the
  <em>Javadoc</em> program, generate the documentation pages, and show
  them during the presentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bring three copies of the <strong>User's Guide</strong> and
<strong>Design Overview</strong> to the presentation. You will give
one to each of the instructors and you should have a paper copy to
look at when there are questions.</p>

<strong>Project Presentation</strong>

<p>The presentations are scheduled to last 10 minutes each with no
break between the presentations. That means, when you time comes, you
should be fully prepared to start, with all projects configured, web
pages loaded, the application ready to run. At home make a list of all
that you will need to do, package the files you need, save them in at
least two different locations (e.g. you and your partner's
<em>myFiles</em>) and know how to get all started using either one of
the lab machines, or your own laptop. If you plan to use your laptop,
make sure you have the power supply, have a backup plan, in case that
fails, know how to use your laptop with the projection.</p>

<p>In the lab we will have several projectors, so that while one group
is presenting another one or two groups can be preparing for the
presentation. That way you will have time to set up your computer,
open the Eclipse, the web browser, add the settings for Eclipse
projects (libraries), and briefly test drive your presentation.</p>

<p>The presentation itself will consist of the following segments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Demo</strong> a 1-2 minute live demo of your project.</li>

<li><strong>Programmer's Overview</strong> 2-3 minutes where you show
the class diagram, the Javadocs, and explain the program
structure. Make sure both partners take turn in presenting this.</li>

<li><strong>Eclipse Project</strong> a 2-3 minute highlights of the
classes that comprise your project. Make sure both partners take turn
in presenting this. You are not required to use Eclipse IDE, but
should be able to navigate to any file within the project with ease.</li>

<li><strong>Question Time</strong> where we will ask questions about
parts of the program. We may direct any of the questions to any of the
partners. Audience is allowed to ask questions as well, but the
instructor will moderate the question session.</li>
</ul>


<strong>Project Evaluation</strong>

<p>We will evaluate both the code submitted to the server and the
different aspects of the actual presentation. For some parts of the
evaluation both partners earn the same points, for some parts of the
presentation each partner's contribution will be assessed separately -
with points earned awarded to each partner individually.</p>

<p>The presentation will be assessed as follows:</p>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Written User's Guide</strong> (joint grade)</li>
  
  <li><strong>Written Design Overview</strong> (joint grade)</li>
  
<li><strong>Demo</strong> (joint grade)</li>

<li><strong>Programmer's Overview and Javadocs</strong>  (individual grade)</li>

<li><strong>Eclipse Project: code overview</strong>  (individual grade)</li>

<li><strong>Question Time</strong>   (individual grade)</li>

</ul>

<p>The code will be graded (after the submission deadline) on the
design clarity, test coverage, documentation, and aesthetics.</p>
