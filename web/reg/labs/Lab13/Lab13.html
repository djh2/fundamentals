Optionally, you may also look at how to design randomizedtests, and how to measure code quality by computing the <em>code mterics</em>.</p><p>You may use anything you learned in this lab to <em>spiffy up</em>your final project. However, keep in mind, that we are more concernedwith good design than <em>flashy trash</em> code.</p><p>Lab instructions as <a href="Lab13/lab13.pdf">pdf</a></p>Download the following file and unzip it.<p>A zip file for the lab <ahref="Lab13/Lab13.zip">Lab13.zip</a></p>Import into your Lab13 project the folder Lab13, then click the box tothe left of Lab13. It should copy all Java sources into the defualtdirectory, and make a folder <em>jptdraw</em> with the file<code>JPTCanvas.java</code> within the <code>jptdraw</code>package.<p>The JPT libraries <ahref="Lab13/jpt.jar">jpt.jar</a></p><hr></hr><p>We have used the following lab in out summer workshop for teachersshows you how to design <em>randomized tests</em>. Look at it if youhave the time - you may use some of these techniques in testing yourfinal project.</p><p>A zip file for the lab on randomized testing<ahref="Lab13/Lab10.zip">Lab10.zip</a></p><p>The jar file you need for this: <ahref="Lab13/quickcheck-0.6.jar">quickcheck-0.6.jar</a></p><hr></hr><p>We have used the following lab in out summer workshop for teachersshows you how to evaluate the quality of the code my measuring some ofits <em>metrics</em>. Look at it if youhave the time - you may use some of these techniques in checking ifyou final project design satisfies the industry expectations for goodcode.</p><p>If you are using lab machines, select <em>Eclipse with Metrics</em>to run your code - it has the <em>Metriacs</em> plugin installed.<p>A zip file for the lab on measuring code metrics <ahref="Lab13/Lab12.zip">Lab12.zip</a></p><hr></hr><!--Comment: ...--> <address></address><!-- hhmts start -->Last modified: Tue Apr  3 13:33:59 EDT 2012 <!-- hhmts end --></body> </html>  </body></html>
