Of course, we will follow the <em>designrecipe</em>, and that means we need to learn how to design tests forthe methods we define.</p><h3  class=section>1&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h3><p>Start the lab by downloading the file <ahref="Calendar.java">Calendar.java</a>. Build a project named<em>Calendar</em> and import the file <em>Calendar.java</em> intoit. Add the </em>tester.jar</em> to the classpath, set us a new</em>RunConfiguration</em> that allows you to run the program, and runthe program.</p><p><em>Note:</em> When using the <em>Browse</em> button to search forthe <em>main</em>, Eclipse will revert the name of the project to thefirst project that used <tt>tester.Main</tt> as its startingclass. Make sure you change it back to your project name beforehitting <em>Apply</em> or <em>Run</em>.<hr></hr><p>The file shows you how we like to organize the code, write thetemplates for each class, write the tests for each class. However, itdoes not have any meaningful code for any of the methods defined there--- the body of each method is only a <em>stub</em>, a place-holderthat produces a useless value of the desired type, so that the programcan be compiled and run. As you can see, three out of four testsfail.</p><ol><li><p>Read the code and make sure you understand what the program is  trying to accomplish. The goal is to build a program that handles  your online calendar. (Of course, we simplify it, so that the amount  of work would be manageable.)</p></li>  <p>Look at the class diagram at the bottom and make sure how the  various classes relate to each other. Read the method headers and  make sure you understand what each method is supposed to do.</p>  <ul>    <li><p>Method <tt>toMinutes</tt> in the class <tt>ClockTime</tt>    should convert the hours and     minutes into the total minutes since midnight on this day</p></li>    <li><p>Method <tt>duration</tt> in the class <tt>Event</tt> should    compute the duration of this event in minutes</p></li>    <li><p>Method <tt>scheduledTime</tt> for the union of classes    <tt>ISchedule</tt> computes the total time during the day that is    already taken up by scheduled events.</p></li>  </ul>  <p>Add an example of two more events and make a new schedule that  includes these events. Then add tests for the methods for these new  examples.</p>  <li><p>Complete the body of the method <tt>toMinutes</tt> in the class  <tt>ClockTime</tt>.</p></li><li><p><p>Complete the body of the method <tt>duration</tt> in the class  <tt>Event</tt>. Notice how the template helps you to see what is  already available and how the rest is easy.</p></li><li><p>Complete the body of the method <tt>scheduledTime</tt> for the  union of classes <tt>ISchedule</tt>.</p>  <p><em>Note:</em> You do not need to deal with overlapping events at  this time.</p></li></ol><p>At this point you should understand how the methods are designed,see that what you have learned in <em>Fundies 1</em> translatesdirectly to the design of method in this new language.</p><h3  class=section>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Designing Methods</h3><p>You will now design several methods on your own. As you design newmethods, make sure to update the template for each class that will beaffected. </p><p>When designing a method, copy the template from its fixed position,add to the template any new information based on the arguments themethod consumes, then design the method. Once you have the methodbody, you can delete the template you have used.</p><ol><li><p>Design the method <tt>isBefore</tt> in the class  <tt>ClockTime</tt> that determines whether this time on the clock is  earlier than the given time.</p>  <p><em>Note:</em> If the times are the same, return <tt>true</tt>.</p></li>  <li><p>Design the method <tt>endsBefore</tt> in the class  <tt>Event</tt> that determines whether this event  ends before the  given event starts.</p></li><li><p>Design the method <tt>overlapHuh</tt> in the class  <tt>Event</tt> that determines whether this event overlaps with the  given event (and you would need to miss a part of one of  them).</p></li><li><p>Design the method <tt>goodScheduleHuh</tt> for the union of classes  <tt>ISchedule</tt> that determines whether the events in this  schedule are ordered according to their starting time, and no events  overlap.</p></li><li><p>Design the method <tt>freeTime</tt> for the union of classes  <tt>ISchedule</tt> that produces a new ISchedule of all the free  times in your day with this schedule. Assume that the schedule that  invokes this method is a good schedule according to the  method  <tt>goodSchedule</tt>.</p></li> </ol><!--Comment: ...--> <address></address><!-- hhmts start -->Last modified: Sun Jan 22 20:07:24 EST 2012 <!-- hhmts end --></body> </html>  </body></html>
