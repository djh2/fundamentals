<h1>CS 2510 Spring 2012:Assignment  12 - Stress Tests; HeapSort,
  Priority Queue</h1>


<h4>Practice Problems</h4>

<p>Review your implementations of the following sorting
algorithms:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Selection sort <em>from the previous lab and from the lectures.</em></p></li>
  <li><p>Insertion sort <em>from the previous assignment.</em></p></li>
  <li><p>QuickSort <em>from Fundies 1 and from the lectures.</em></p></li>
  <li><p>Binary Tree Sort <em>from the assignment that dealt with
  binary search trees.</em></p></li>
  <li><p>MergeSort <em>from Fundies 1 and from the lectures.</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Try to implement the <em>QuickSort</em> and the
<em>MergeSort</em>. In both cases, you probably want to use two
<tt>ArrayList</tt>s, one that provides the data to sort, and the other
where you save the results of the next step in the <em>divide and
conquer</em> process.</p>

<em>Note:</em> This is not exactly a practice problem, but it is
something you should try to do, think about, and research a bit to
gain fluency with more complex algorithms.</p>

<h3>Pair Programming Assignment</h3>

<p>
These problems should be checked into your pair's SVN repository by
the due date, which is WEDNESDAY 4/11/2012 at 11:59pm.
</p>

<h3>Project naming requirements</h3>

The names of the projects and some of the project files must be
exactly the same as specified in the assignment. Failure to do so
makes it impossible for the graders to run your submission and results
in immediate loss of at least 50% of the homework credit.

Every file you submit must have a header that identifies you and the
problem it solves. So, for the <em>heapsort</em> problem the header should look
like this:

<pre>
// Assignment 12 Problem 1
// Partner Name1
// partner1username
// Partner Name2
// partner2username
// 11 April 2012
</pre>

<p>Submit your report as a <em>.doc</em>, <em>.docx</em> or a
<em>.pdf</em> file. Open source equivalent of <em>.docx</em> is also
acceptable. Name it <strong><em>TimingReport.xxx</em></strong></p>


<p>Submit your Excel chart as a <em>.xls</em> or a <em>.xlsx</em>
file. Open source equivalent of <em>.xlsx</em> is also
acceptable. Name it <strong><em>TimingResults.xxx</em></strong></p> 


<h2>Problem 1: HeapSort and Priority Queue</h2>

<h2>Problem 2: Timing Trials</h2>

<p>
Finish problems in part one and part two of the lab.
