<h1>CS 2510 Spring 2012: Assignment 2 - Data Definitions</h1>


<h4>Practice Problems</h4>

<p>Work out as the following exercises from the textbook. Do not add them
to your assignment submission, though you should keep them in your
electronic portfolio in a separate directory of your pair's
repository, e.g., <em>Portfolio-myName-02</em>.</p> 

<p><strong>Problems:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Problem 2.4 on page 17</li>

<li>Problem 3.1 on page 25</li>

<li>Problem 4.4 on page 33</li>

<li>Problem 5.3 on page 44</li>

<li>Problem 5.9 on page 51</li>

<li>Problem 10.2 on page 97</li>

<li>Problem 10.5 on page 105</li>

<li>Problem 14.1 on page 140</li>

<li>Problem 14.7 on page 144</li>

</ol>

<h4>Pair Programming Assignment</h4>

<p>These problems should be checked into your pair's SVN repository
by the due date.</p>

<p><strong>Project naming requirements</strong></p>
<p>The names of the projects and some of the project files must be
exactly the same as specified in the assignment. Failure to do so
makes it impossible for the graders to run your submission and results
in immediate <strong>loss of at least 50%</strong> of the homework credit.</p>

<h3>Problem 1</h3>

<P>Create a project with the name <tt>HW02Problem1</tt>. Your
<tt>java</tt> file must be named <tt>Cities.java</tt> and the 
<em>Examples</em> class inside this file must be named
<tt>ExamplesCities</tt>.</p> 

<ol>
<li><p>Convert your data representation for US cities from the previous
  assignment into data definitions in the <tt>FunJava</tt>
  language. (i.e., create a class <tt>City</tt>)</p></li>

<li><p>Make sure you have a separate class <tt>Loc</tt> for the location
  coordinates in latitude and longitude</p></li>

<li><p>Define a class hierarchy that represents a <tt>list of
    cities</tt>. Follow the <em>Design Recipe for Data Definitions</em>.
  Remember to make examples of data in the <tt>ExamplesCities</tt>
    class.</p></li>
</ol>    

<hr></hr>

<h3>Problem 2</h3>

<P>Create a project with the name <tt>HW02Problem2</tt>. Answers to
this problem should be placed in a Java file named
<tt>Lunches.java</tt> and the <em>Examples</em> class inside this file must be named
<tt>ExamplesLunches</tt>.</p> 


<p>Design the classes (i.e., a <em>class hierarchy</em>) to represent
lunch orders in a soup and salad bar.  For lunch a customer can choose a soup (soups have
different flavors), a salad (one of several kinds, as well as a choice
of several choices of dressings), and a bread. For each of the lunch
parts we need to know whether or not they are <em>vegetarian</em>.</p>

<p>The restaurant has different prices for every soup and for every
  salad, but all breads cost the same and there is no extra charge for
  dressing for the salad.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Make examples of at least two of each: soup, salad, dressings, and
  breads.</p></li>

<li><p>Make at least four examples of lunch orders where at least one of
  them must be vegetarian.</p>

  <p><em>Note:</em>Make these examples as if you were actually
  ordering the lunch, i.e., write down on a piece of paper the
  information you are hoping to represent in your code. Use these
  notes later to guide you in designing exmples of data for your data definitions.</p></li>
  
<li><p>Now design the class that represents the entire lunch order, this
  class should be named
  <tt>Lunch</tt>. Of course, you will need several other classes,
  maybe a union of classes, maybe a class that references another
  class, etc. You can name all the other classes and interfaces as you wish, but
  make sure your names are sensible and that your class names start
  with a <em>capital letter</em> and the interface names start with
  the <em>capital letter</em> <tt>I</tt>. </p></li>

<li><p>Convert your original examples of lunch orders into data in the
  <tt>ExamplesLunches</tt> class.</p> 
</ol>
