<h1>CS 2510 Spring 2012:Assignment  13 - The Final Project</h1>


<h3>Project goals and logistics</h3>

<p>The goal of this assignment is to give you the opportunity to use all
the concepts we have learned in the design and implementation of a
small project. The project will involve user interactions, but the
core is the design of the functionality, following the design recipes,
building abstractions, and using the existing libraries. Good design
and a simple user interaction part is much more valuable than a flashy
user interactions with poor design of the program that drives it.</p>

<p>You should finish the design and most of the implementation of your project by
the morning of Tuesday, April 17th. The project presentation will be
done during the regular lab times on Tuesday, April 17th (from 9:00 am
till 4:10 pm) and during the regular lecture times on Wednesday, April
18th (i.e. 9:15 am - 10:20 am and 1:35 pm - 2:40 pm). All
presentations will be done in the lab in 212 WVH.</p>

<p>You can then use the rest of the time on Tuesday and Wednesday to finish the
project, incorporate the suggestions given during the project review,
and check your final version into your pair's SVN repository by
the due date, which is WEDNESDAY 4/18/2012 at 11:59pm.</p>


<h3>Project naming requirements</h3>

<p>The names of the project and some of the project files must be
exactly the same as specified in the assignment. Failure to do so
makes it impossible for the graders to run your submission and results
in immediate loss of at least 50% of the homework credit.</p>

<p>Every file you submit must have a header that identifies you and the
problem it solves.</p>

<pre>
// Assignment 13 Final Project
// Partner Name1
// partner1username
// Partner Name2
// partner2username
// 18 April 2012
</pre>

<p>Submit your <em>Design Document</em> and your <em>User's Guide</em>
as a <em>.doc</em>, <em>.docx</em> or a 
<em>.pdf</em> file. Open source equivalent of <em>.docx</em> is also
acceptable. Name these files <strong><em>DesignDoc.xxx</em></strong>
and <strong><em>UsersGuide.xxx</em></strong></p>


<p>Name the class that contains the tests and the <code>main</code>
method that runs your tests and the project
<em>ExamplesProject.java</em></p>

<h3>Project details</h3>

<p>To design this project you should use the <em>impsoundworld</em>
library that supports the design of interactive games using imperative
style (instead of creating a new <em>world</em> after each tick, key
event, or a mouse click, the state of the <em>world</em>
changes). Additionally, the <em>tunes</em> library allows you to
create musical background music, or simple sound effects. The web
pages for these libraries provide the documentation, explanation of
how the library can be used, and several sample programs you can use
as guides.</p>

<p>Here are the links to some of these resources.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/javalib">javalib</a> the main
  website for the <em>javalib</em> collection of libraries</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/javalib/SoundLib">SoundLib</a> the main
  website for the older version of the sound library, but with
  up-to-date details
  about creating music, musical effects, and sound effects.</li> 

  <li><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/javalib/SoundWorld">SoundWorld</a> the 
  website for the current version of the sound library.</li> 

  <li><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/javalib/AppletWorld">AppletWorld</a> the 
  website for the imperative library that describes in a greater
  detail the
  creation of Applets.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/javalib/ImpWorld">ImpWorld</a> the 
  website for the current version of the imperative world library that
  describes in detail how the images are created in the imperative
  style (and describes the overall design of the games in imperative style).</li>

  <li><a href="jpt.jar">jpt.jar</a> a library that supports the design
  of GUIs (used for the <em>Travel Advisor USA</em> option).</li>
  
</ul>

<h3>Project options</h3>

<p>Choose one of the three options for the project. Choose the
option you feel most competent to tackle, and that interests you the
most.</p>

<p>Here is a brief overview of the three options:</p>

<h3>Option 1: Musical Frogger Game</h3>

<p>Design an interactive <em>frogger</em> game with sound effects,
using the <em>impsoundworld</em> library.</p>

<p>A frog is trying to cross the road with several lines of cars
moving in both directions, then cross the stream by hopping onto lily
pads floating in the river, making sure not to fall into the raging
stream to get to its home on the other bank. You may give the frog
several chances to try to reach its home. Play a background music, add
sound effects when bad or good things happen to the frog.</p>

<h3>Option 2: Musical Marion Game</h3>

<p>Design an interactive <em>mario</em> game with sound effects,
using the <em>impsoundworld</em> library.</p>

<p>Marion is a little guy (or a little girl) walking along from left to
right. Or it seems so. Because while Marion is always at the same
horizontal distance from the left, obstacles she has to avoid or use to
jump from move from right to left. She needs to jump over obstacles
(the player uses keys to prod her along), may get a boost when jumping
from some special ones, have several lives, count the distance
traveled, etc.  Play a background music, add
sound effects when bad or good things happen to Marion.</p>


<h3>Option 3: Travel Advisor USA</h3>

<p>Design a travel advisor that will show the user how to find a route
from one US state to another - with animated graphical displays as well
as written directions. A framework for this project is already in
place. Your job is to implement the three graph traversal algorithms
(<em>the Breadth First Search or BFS, the Depth First Search or DFS,
and the Shortest Path or SP algorithm</em>), to display the progress
of the algorithm, and to provide the directions for each leg of the
journey as text (e.g. <em>go 130 miles West from Boston to
Albany</em>). The only sound effects you need to add would be a ping
as each edge changes color to indicate that the algorithm looked at it
and took some actions. Of course, you can use any of the <em>Java
Collection Framework</em> classes to manage your data.</p>

<p>The details for this project with a number of <em>starter
files</em> can be found <a
href="GraphProject/GraphAlgorithmResources.html">here</a>.</p> 

<hr></hr>

<h3>Project Requirements and Assessment</h3>

<p>The project grade will cover the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The design document</li>

<li>The design of the program model</li>

<li>The user's guide</li>

<li>The design of the user's interactions</li>

<li>The project presentation</li>

</ul>

<p>Of course, the design of appropriate tests is an integral part of the
design of any program (<em>just in case you have not yet realized
this</em>).</p> 

<h4>The design document</h4>

<p>One part of the credit for this assignment will be given for a design
document that describes the data, the organization of the program, the
key program components, and the design of tests. Imagine you want
someone to keep improving your program --- provide a road map that
explains what your program does and how does it do it. This document
should complement the Javadoc generated web pages. A separate document
will give you a more detailed guidelines for what we expect.</p>

<h4>The design of the program model</h4>

<p>One part of the credit for this assignment is for the model part: the
design of the behavior of the program apart from the user interfaces.</p>

<h4>The user's guide</h4>

<p>The user of your program needs to know the rules of the game, how to
run the algorithm animation, or what are the features of your musical
exploration program. You need to create a user's guide that will
explain concisely what to expect of your program and how to interact
with it.</p>

<h4>The design of the user's interactions</h4>

<p>You will also get credit is for the user interactions (view) ---
grading both the design 
of the user views and the design of the program that drives it. A
small bonus may be earned for exceptionally well designed display or
interactions. It is better if the user interaction is simple, but is
well designed and documented, than if a fancy 
GUI display is driven by a code that another programmer cannot understand
and maintain.</p>

<h4>Project presentation</h4>

<p>You will present your project (both partners together) during the lecture
on Thursday. Each partner should be able to 
describe any part of the code in the project, regardless of <em>who
    wrote it</em>, as we expect that both partners work on the project
together. More information about the presentations will be provided
shortly.</p>

<hr></hr>


<h3>The Advice</h3>

<p>The design part of each project typically takes the greatest amount of
time. the more time you spend thinking things through, the easier it
is to actually write the code.</p>

<p>Make sure you think the whole framework through before you start
programming. Spend some time researching the Java libraries to see
what tasks can be done using the existing tools. Write sample adapters
to see how the existing class can be used in your setting.</p>

<p>Then design the key component by specifying their interfaces --- the
method headers, the interfaces that various classes must implement or
use to get information from others.</p>

<p>For now, you have not learned about various tools and techniques to
support such design process --- other than class diagrams. Any
description that you find helpful in clarifying the roles of the
different classes and interfaces in your program is acceptable.</p>

<p>The design document you produce should include a brief user's guide,
give a general overview of the 
project organization as well as describe all data definitions and the
key methods. The Javadocs supplement this with detailed information
about the actual implementation.</p>
