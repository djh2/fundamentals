Design a data definition to represent a city in that contains this information for a single locality.</p><p>Note 1: We may have several different entries for a given city, for example Boston would include the zip code 02115 and 02116, though each has a slightly different latitude and longitude.</p><p>Note 2: Define the location of each locality as a separate data definition (long/lat).</p><p>Sample data for some zip codes for the capitals of NE states would be:</p><ul><li>02115, Boston, MA, 71.092215, 42.342706</li><li>06120, Hartford, CT, 72.675807, 41.78596</li><li>04330, Augusta, ME, 69.766548, 44.323228</li><li>03301, Concord, NH, 71.527734, 43.218525</li><li>05602, Montpelier, VT, 72.576992, 44.264082</li><li>02908, Providence, RI, 71.437684, 41.838294</li></ul><h3>Problem 2</h3><p>We want to draw the cities on a map of the United States. Suppose our map is 100 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall. Design a function, named <code>to-posn</code>, that converts a representation of a location into a posn on the map.</p><p>Assume that the latitude and longitude lines are parallel to the Scene boundaries (known as parallel projection). Also assume the following:</p><ul><li>the left edge of the Scene is at 125 degrees longitude (in the Western Hemisphere)</li><li>the right edge is at 65 degrees longitude (also in the Western hemisphere)</li><li>the top of the Scene is at 50 degrees latitude (in the Northern hemisphere)</li><li>the bottom is at 20 degrees latitude (in the Northern hemisphere),/li></ul><p>Assume that we are focused only on the contiguous continental states  (i.e., we omit the beautiful states of Alaska and Hawaii... please accept our appologies).</p><h3>Problem 3</h3>Modify the function <code>to-posn</code> and name it <code>to-posn-par</code> (-- for <em>parametrized</em> --) so that it consumes the width and the height of the Canvas (with the US map stretching over the entire Canvas).<h3>Problem 4</h3><p>Design a function <code>distance</code> that computes the distance (in miles) between two cities. Estimates tell us that one degree of longitude (at the USA's latitude) is approximately 55 miles, and one degree of latitude is approximately 70 miles. (Feel free to make more accurate estimates. If you do so, explain how you arrived at your numbers.)</p><h3>Problem 5</h3><p>Design a function <code>total-distance</code> that computes the total length of a trip where you visit all cities in a list of cities in the order given in the list (assume you are a bird... or a plane... or superman).</p><p><em>Note:</em> First design the function following the <em>Design Recipe</em>, then modify the function to be in accumulator style. (Hand in only the accumulator style function. Make sure your purpose statement includes a line that explains the role of the accumulator.)</p><h3>Problem 6</h3><p>Design a function <code>all-states</code> that produces a list of all the states visited on a given trip through a list of cities. Make sure each state appears in the list only once.</p><p><em>Note 1:</em> Design the function in stages: first follow the Design Recipe with the necessary local function definitions,  then optimize the function so it traverses the list of cities only once.</p><p><em>Note 2:</em> You will get partial credit if you hand in only the functions that follow the <em>Design Recipe</em>.</p><strong>Important: Use check-expects to test your functions.</strong><hr></hr><p>Combine all data definitions and solutions into one DrRacket file and name it <code>HW1</code> before submitting. Make sure the beginning of your file contains the header that identifies you and your partner as shown on the coourse web page.</p><hr></hr><!--Create another directory in classes where you will keep all library (JAR) files, call it EclipseJars. For the rest of the Lab/term we will refer to these two directories as EclipseWorkspace and EclipseJars. Keep the file/explorer window open, we'll be using it later in the Lab.--> <hr></hr><!--<p>The nine programs cover the following topics:<ul>  <li><p>Book1.java&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple definition of one class with  examples of data and a drawing of the class diagram.</p></li>  <li><p>Book2.java&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of designing methods for a simple  class, including the <em>template</em> and tests.</p></li>  <li><p>Book3.java&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A class definition with a field that is an  instance of another class (reference).</p></li>  <li><p>Book4.java&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A class definition for a union of classes  (<em>i.e. classes that implement a common interface</em>), together  with the examples of designing methods for these classes.
