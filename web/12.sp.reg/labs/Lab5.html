Browse through the pages and see how the <tt>World</tt> isbuilt. Build a project named <em>WorldGames</em> and import the filesand  <em>TickyTack.java</em> inton it. Download three additional<em>jar</em> files: <em>funworld.jar</em>, <em>colors.jar</em>, and<em>geometry.jar</em> and add them tho the classpath. The links aregiven at the <em>FunWorld</em> instruction page. Add the </em>tester.jar</em> to the classpath, setus a new </em>RunConfiguration</em> that allows you to run theprogram for each of these two programs, and run each of the games.</p><p>You can use these programs as a guide for how to use the variousfeatures of our library.</p><h3  class=section>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting familiar with the Ocean World.</h3><p>We will now design most of the game that has been the topic ofseveral lectures: the <em>OceanWorld</em>.<ol><li><p> Start a new project named <tt>OceanWorld</tt> and import into  it the file <a  href="OceanWorld.java">OceanWorld.java</a>. It  contains most of the code shown on the course <em>blog</em> with   some additions and changes.</p> <p>You will also need two images that the program uses:   <a href="shark.png">shark.png</a>  and   <a  href="pink-fish.png">pink-fish.png</a>. Download  them anad save them in your project directory --- the one that  contains the <em>src</em> subdirectory.</p>    <p>Read the code, then run the program and  check the results.</p></li><li><p>Design the method <tt>onKeyEvent</tt> that moves the shark upand down in response to the <tt>"up"</tt> and <tt"down"</tt>keys. Make sure you follow the design recipe and have tests for allmethods. </p></li> <li><p>Design the method <tt>onTick</tt> that moves the school of fish3 pixels to the left. Make sure you follow the design recipe and havetests for all methods. </p></li><li><p>Modify the method <tt>onTick</tt> so that every fish thatescaped to the left is replaced by a new one on the right. Make sureyou follow the design recipe and have tests for all methods. </p></li><li><p>Design the method <tt>worldEnds</tt> that ends the world whenthe shark's health is below some fixed threshold (for example 3). Makesure you follow the design recipe and have tests for all methods. </p></li></ol><p>Make sure you keep updating the <em>TEMPLATE</em> as you goalong.</p> <p>When designing a method, copy the template from its fixed position,add to the template any new information based on the arguments themethod consumes, then design the method. Once you have the methodbody, you can delete the template you have used.</p><hr></hr><h3  class=section>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Designing the game</h3><p>You are now on your own -- we want you to finish designing this game.</p><ol><li><p>Design the method that modifies the way school of fish moves, so that  if the fish has moved off the canvas, it is replaced by a new fish  somewhere on the left.</p></li>  <li><p>Design the method <tt>worldEnd</tt> that ends the world when  the shark starves to death. The user should see a message that  indicates what had happened.</p></li>  <li><p>Design the method that produces the food value of the first  fish in the school that is close  enough to the shark to be shark's food.</p></li>  <li><p>Design the method <tt>eatFish(int foodValue)</tt> that produces a  healthier shark, after the shark has devoured the given fish.</p></li>  <li><p>Suppose a fish is to be eaten by a shark. Design the method  <tt>sharkFood</tt> in the class <tt>Fish</tt> that produces a new  fish, now that <tt>this</tt> on has vanished.</p></li>  <li><p>Now design the method that replaces the first fish in the  school that can be eaten by the shark by a new fish at the other end  of the ocean.</p></li>  <li><p>By now you should have all the parts of the game and should be  able to play the game.</p></li></ol><p><strong>ENJOY!</strong></p><!--Comment: ...--> <address></address><!-- hhmts start -->Last modified: Tue Feb  7 09:47:07 EST 2012 <!-- hhmts end --></body> </html>  </body></html>
