<h1>CS 2510 Spring 2012:Assignment 5 - Designing Games</h1>


<h4>Partners Work Log</h4>

<p>Starting with this assignment we are adding a new requirement for
reporting on the work you do on each assignment. In the workplace the
programmers often need to report on time sheets the time they spent on
various projects, so that the customer can be billed and the project
leader can monitor how the budget for the project is being used
up. So, we want you to report the time you spend working on the
problems not just at the completion, but as you work on the
problems.</p>

<p>You are already keeping logs of your meetings with the partners and
what happened at each meeting (<em>Are you not?  ... you are supposed
to do so.</em>). All you need to do is to keep this log as a simple
formatted text file, add to it the report on each meeting, and check
it in every time you check in your work into the repository.</p>

<p>We will check the logs, can use them to see if both partners are
active on the projects, get some feedback on the difficulty of the
different problems, and hope this will help you in maintaining good
working partnerships. While the log reports on both partners, if your
partner does not show up for a scheduled meeting, or you are having
difficulty reaching your partner, you can check in a report that
indicates this. Your partner can contest this, but it will be retained
in the repository.</p>

<p>Use the <a href="SampleLog.rtf">SampleLog.rtf</a> as a guide for
the format and the type of information you may include in the
log. Adopt it so it works for you.</p>

<p><strong>We will deduct points from your homework if the log is not
checked in. We reserve the right to decide how severe the penalty will
be.</strong></p> 

<hr></hr>

<h4>Practice Problems</h4>

<p>Work out as the following exercises from the textbook. Do not add them
to your assignment submission, though you should keep them in your
electronic portfolio in your own <em>svn</em> repository.</p> 

<p><strong>Problem 1</strong></p>

  
<ul><li>
<p>Add to the <em>TickyTack</em> example from Lab 5 a new class that
represents a person. The person has a <tt>pinhole</tt> (the center of
its image), the <tt>width</tt> and <tt>height</tt>, and a
<tt>color</tt>.</p></li>

<li><p>In this class design the method <tt>personImage</tt> that
produces a <tt>WorldImage</tt> of this person. It could be just a
stick figure, or you can be more fancy.</p></li>

<li><p>In the class <tt>House</tt> add a field that represents a
person (standing in the door), and modify the constructor, so that it
constructs a new <tt>Person</tt> that has the <tt>width</tt> and
<tt>height</tt> of the door to this house, is standing in the middle
of the door, and has any color you
choose. Then modify the method <tt>houseImage</tt> so that it draws
the image of the person for this house.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Problem 2</strong></p>

<p>Finish designing the ocean world game you have been working on in
Lab 5.</p>

<hr></hr>

<h4>Pair Programming Assignment</h4>

<p>These problems should be checked into your pair's SVN repository
by the due date.</p>

<p><strong>Project naming requirements</strong></p>
<p>The names of the projects and some of the project files must be
exactly the same as specified in the assignment. Failure to do so
makes it impossible for the graders to run your submission and results
in immediate <strong>loss of at least 50%</strong> of the homework
credit.</p>

<p>Every file you submit must have a header that identifies you and
the problem it solves. So, for the first problem the header should
look like this:</p>

<pre>
// Assignment 5 Problem 1
// Partner Name1
// partner1username
// Partner Name2
// partner2username
// 14 February 2012
</pre>


<h3>Problem 1</h3>

<P>Create a project with the name <tt>HW05Problem1</tt>.  Your
<tt>java</tt> file must be named <tt>Game.java</tt> and the 
<em>Examples</em> class inside this file must be named
<tt>ExamplesGame</tt>.</p>

<p>You are ready (and eager) to design yet another interactive
graphics based game. This is your chance.</p>

<p>Use the <em>funworld</em> library to design an interactive
game.</p>

<p>The game should have at least two different kinds of
objects. At least one of these objects should appear on the game
multiple times (apples falling from the tree, shots fired from an UFO,
cars that the chicken crossing the road has to avoid).</p>

<p>The game should involve at least two different kinds ways that the
game changes - on tick, in response to a key event, or in response to
the mouse click.</p>

<p>There should be at least one way that the game ends. The example
code for the <em>TickyTack</em> world illustrates the two ways the
game can end - either checked after each tick, or signalled by a key
event or a mouse event.<p>

<p>Include at the beginning of your code a brief description of the
game, the rules for the game. Also, draw the class diagram that shows
the code organization for the game. It could be in any format and can
be a separate file named <em>ClassDiagram</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Advice:</strong> Start with a simple game and build it up
if you have the time and energy. We care about good design more than
flashy tricks.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>If you cannot think of a game, here are some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A chicken, controlled by the arrow keys, is trying to cross the
  street, avoiding the cars. You may give the player ten attempts and
  show the score at the end.</p></li>

<li><p>Apples are falling from a tree, and the player moves the basket
  left and right, trying to catch the falling apples, avoiding bad
  apples (as a bad apple spoils the bushel and the game ends.</p></li>

<li><p>The <em>pong</em> game --- with paddle on the bottom, trying to
  hit the ball, so it bounces back. The game stops after the player
  missed ten shots.</p></li>

<li><p>Monsters jump up at random on the screen, we need to click the
  mouse to kill them. They win if we miss ten times.</p></li>
</ul>
