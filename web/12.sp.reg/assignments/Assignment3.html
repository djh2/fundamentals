<h1>CS 2510 Spring 2012: Assignment 3 - Designing Methods</h1>


<h4>Practice Problems</h4>

<p>Work out as the following exercises from the textbook. Do not add them
to your assignment submission, though you should keep them in your
electronic portfolio in your own <em>svn</em> repository.</p> 

<p><strong>Problems:</strong></p>

<ol>
  

<li>Problem 10.2 on page 97</li>

<li>Problem 10.3 on page 97</li>

<li>Problem 10.4 on page 97</li>

<li>Problem 10.5 on page 105</li>

<li>Problem 11.2 on page 116</li>

<li>Problem 12.1 on page 129</li>

<li>Problem 12.4 on page 131</li>

</ol>

<h4>Pair Programming Assignment</h4>

<p>These problems should be checked into your pair's SVN repository
by the due date.</p>

<p><strong>Project naming requirements</strong></p>
<p>The names of the projects and some of the project files must be
exactly the same as specified in the assignment. Failure to do so
makes it impossible for the graders to run your submission and results
in immediate <strong>loss of at least 50%</strong> of the homework
credit.</p>

<p>Every file you submit must have a header that identifies you and
the problem it solves. So, for the first problem the header should
look like this:</p>

<pre>
// Assignment 2 Problem 1
// Partner Name1
// partner1username
// Partner Name2
// partner2username
// 24 January 2012
</pre>

<h3>Problem 1</h3>

<P>Create a project with the name <tt>HW03Problem1</tt>. Your
<tt>java</tt> file must be named <tt>CitiesMethods.java</tt> and the 
<em>Examples</em> class inside this file must be named
<tt>ExamplesCities</tt>.</p> 

<p>For this program use the classes you have defined in the previous
assignment that represent the US cities and states.</p> 

<ol>
<li><p>Design the method the method <tt>sameState</tt> that determines
  whether a city is in the given state.</p></li>  

<li><p>Design the method <tt>isSouthOfHuh</tt> that determines whether
one city is located South of another city.</p></li> 

<li><p>Design the method <tt>distanceTo</tt> that computes the
distance from one city to another. Use the same formula you have used
in the first assignment to compute the distance.</p></li> 

<li><p>Design the method <tt>toPosn</tt> that produces a <tt>Posn</tt>
that corresponds to the location of this city in a Canvas of the given
<tt>width</tt> and <tt>height</tt>.</p>

<p>The given <tt>Posn</tt> class allows you to use <tt>double</tt> type of
data for the coordinates.</p></li> 
  
<li><p>Design the method <tt>totalDistance</tt> that computes the
distance we have to travel from the first city in the route to the last
one, going through all cities on the route in the given order.</p></li>
  
<li><p>Design the method <tt>addCity</tt> that produces a modified
route that adds a visit to the given city after the specified city on
the route. If the specified city is not on our route, just add the
given city at the end of the route.</p>

<p>For example, if our trip goes from Boston to Concord to Hartford,
and I ask to add Montpelier after Concord, then the new route will go
from Boston to Concord to Montpelier to Hartford. However, if for the
same route I ask to add Montpelier after Portsmouth, the new route
will go from Boston to Concord to Hartford, and then to
Montpelier.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> When checking whether two cities are the same, it is
sufficient to compare the names, the states, and the zip codes of the
two cities.</p></li> 
  
<li><p>Design the method <tt>hasLoop</tt> that determines whether
when traveling along the route we will return to one of the cities
more than once (including at the end of the route).</p></li>   

</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure you follow the <em>design
recipe</em> including showing all the templates in your code.</p>

<h3>Problem 2</h3>

<p>The goal of this problem is to see how Java dispatches the method
invocation to the class to which the object belongs.</p>

<p>Create a project with the name <tt>HW02Problem2</tt>. Import into
it the file <a href="ExcelCells.java"><tt>ExcelCells.java</tt></a>. You will add your solutions to
this file and submit this file for this problem.</p>

<p>For this problem we use classes that represent data in the cells of
a spreadsheet. For each cell we record its row and column, where the
cell is located, and the data <tt>IData</tt> stored. An <tt>IData</tt>
is either a number <tt>int</tt>, a reference to another cell, or an
<tt>IFormula</tt>. Each formula can be one of three possible functions:
<em>+</em> (representing addition), </em>min</em> (producing the
minimum of the two cells), or <em>*</em> (computing the product) and
involves two other cells in the computation.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Make an example of the following spreadsheet segment:</p>

<pre>
   |      A     |     B    |   C     |   D   |      E     |
 --+------------+----------+---------+-------+------------+
 1 |      8     |     3    |   4     |   6   |      2     |
 --+------------+----------+---------+-------+------------+
 2 | min(A1,E1) | +(B1,C1) | ref(A3) |       |  *(B2,D1)  |
 --+------------+----------+---------+-------+------------+
 3 |  *(A1,A2)  | +(B2,B1) |         |       | min(C2,D1) |
 --+------------+----------+---------+-------+------------+
 4 |            | +(B3,B2) |         |       | min(B4,D1) |
 --+------------+----------+---------+-------+------------+
 5 |            | +(B4,B3) |         |       |  *(B5,E4)  |
 --+------------+----------+---------+-------+------------+
</pre>
</li>

<li><p>Draw this spreadsheet on paper and fill in the values that
should show in each cell. Copy the data above and replace the contents
of every cell with its value. Include it as a block comment in your
<tt>ExamplesExcelCells</tt> class. </p></li>

<li><p>Add a new function <tt>AbsDiff</tt> to the options for the
spreadsheet  formulas that computes the absolute value of the
difference between the two given operands.</p>

<p>Make sure you add the appropriate examples for this new type of data.</li>

<li><p>Design the method <tt>eval</tt> that computes the value of a
cell. <em>Hint:</em> follow the recipe... examples really help.</p></li> 

</p></li> 

<li><p>Design the method <tt>countFuns</tt> that computes the number
of function applications (Formulas) involved in computing the value of
a cell.</p></li>  

<li><p>Design the method <tt>countPlus</tt> that computes the number
of <tt>Plus</tt> applications needed to compute the value of a
cell.</p></li>   
</ol>
