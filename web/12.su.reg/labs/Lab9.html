Scroll through the <tt>All Classes</tt> in the lower leftframe to find the <tt>Comparable</tt> and <tt>Comparator</tt>interfaces. You can see from the descriptions that there is a lot ofdetail, much more than we would expect from such a simplefunction-object. We will address some of these issues in the lectures.</p><p>Scroll through the <em>All Classes</em> frame on the left again andfind the <tt>ArrayList</tt> class.  In lecture we discussed a number ofmethods we can use to modify/manipulate and instance of<tt>ArrayList</tt>.  Use the online documentation as you work on thispart of the lab.</p> <h3  class=section>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding ArrayList.</h3>For this part of the lab download the file <ahref="ExamplesArrayList.java">ExamplesArrayList.java</a>, whichcontains two classes: the <tt>ExamplesArrayList</tt> class and the<tt>Person</tt> class. Start a new project, <em>Lab9</em> and importthis file into it. Your goal in this part of the lab is to designa test suite for the methods defined for the <tt>Arraylist</tt>.</p><ol><li><p>Run the project as is and read the code to see what it  does. As you can see, it tests the method <code>size</code> for the  class <code>ArrayList</code></p></li><li><p>Read in the documentation for the method  <code>add</code>. Add the tests that verify the correctness of both  variants of the method <code>add</code></p></li><li><p>Read in the documentation for the methods  <code>isEmpty</code> and <code>remove</code>. Add the tests that  verify the correctness of these method</p></li><li><p>Read in the documentation for the method  <code>remove</code>. Add the tests that verify the correctness of both  variants of the method <code>remove</code>. Notica, that the variant  that removes the desired object uses the identity version of  equality for finding the desired object</p></li><li><p>Read in the documentation for the method  <code>set</code>. Add the tests that  verify the correctness of this method. Make sure you test both the  <em>effect</em> and the value that the method produces.</p></li></ol><h3  class=section>3&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutating ArrayList.</h3><p>Continue with the current project and test suite. Define a newinstance of <code>ArrayList</code> as follows:</p><pre>ArrayList<Person> arlistSame = this.arlist; </pre><p>right after <code>this.arlist</code> has been declared.</p><ol><li><p>Define a newinstance of <code>ArrayList</code> as follows:</p><pre>ArrayList<Person> arlistSame = this.arlist; </pre><p>right after <code>this.arlist</code> has been declared. Think of  what this means, then augment all tests so you would   also test what is happening to the <code>arlistSame</code></p></li><li><p>Now add the following field definition right after the previous  one:</p><pre>ArrayList<Person> arlistOther; </pre><p>and as the last line of the method <code>initList</code> add the  following line:</p><pre>this.arlistOther = new ArrayList<Person>(this.arlist); </pre>  <p>Think of  what this means, then augment all tests so you would   also test what is happening to the <code>arlistOther</code>. Draw a  picture that shows the difference between the three lists.</p></li>  <li>Finally, design the method <tt>swapAtIndices</tt> that swaps the elements  of the given <tt>ArrayList</tt> at the two given positions (indices).  Make sure that this method works for any \code{ArrayList}... it  should be parametrized as we did in Lecture.</ol><hr></hr><h3  class=section>4&nbsp;&nbsp;Generating Javadocs</h3><p>Spend a few minutes to learn how to generate web pagesof your documentation for this project. Notice that we have alreadystarted to write all purpose statements and comments using the<em>JavaDoc</em> format.  Under the <em>Project</em> menu select<em>Generate Javadoc</em> and then select the files that should be usedto generate the documentation (likely your entire project).  Byconvention we typically generate JavaDoc files into a directory named<tt>docs</tt> at the same level as the <src>src</tt> directory.  Besure to fix any warnings and problems with the generation.<hr></hr><h3  class=section>5&nbsp;&nbsp;Binary Search</h3><p>This problem will be a part fo the homework assignment, but you canstart working on it now.</p><p>Start with a new project HW09Problem1 and create two files: <tt>Algorithms.java</tt>and <tt>ExamplesAlgorithms.java</tt>. </p><ol><li><p>In the class <tt>ExamplesAlgorithmms</tt> make examples of sorted<tt>ArrayList</tt>s of<tt>String</tt>s and <tt>Integer</tt>s.Of course, there is no constructor that creates an<tt>ArrayList</tt> filled with values. You need to define a method<tt>initData</tt> that adds the values to the initially empty<tt>ArrayList</tt>s one at a time.</p></li><li><p>Next, design two classes that implement the <tt>Comparator</tt>interface in Java Collections --- one that compares <tt>String</tt>sby lexicographical ordering, one that compares <tt>Integer</tt>s bytheir magnitude.</p></li><li><p>Now, design the method <tt>binarySearch</tt> in the class  <tt>Algorithms</tt> that consumes the lower index (inclusive), the  upper index (exclusive), an <tt>ArrayList</tt> of data of the type  <tt>T</tt>, a <tt>Comparator</tt> of the type <tt>T</tt>, and  an object of the type <tt>T</tt> and produces the index for this  object in the given <tt>ArrayList</tt> or throws a  <tt>RuntimeException</tt> if the object is not found. </p></li></ol><hr></hr><!--Comment: ...--> <address></address><!-- hhmts start -->Last modified: Tue Mar 13 00:13:45 EDT 2012 <!-- hhmts end --></body> </html>  </body></html>
