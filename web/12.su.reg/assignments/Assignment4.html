<h1>CS 2510 Spring 2012: Assignment 4 - Methods for Unions;
Abstracting over Data Definitions</h1>


<h4>Practice Problems</h4>

<p>Work out as the following exercises from the textbook. Do not add them
to your assignment submission, though you should keep them in your
electronic portfolio in your own <em>svn</em> repository.</p> 

<p><strong>Problems:</strong></p>


  

<p>Problem 15.8 on page 175</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Of course, to do this problem you need to also
define the classes that represent this problem and make examples of
data - though all of that is already shown in the textbook.</p>

<hr></hr>

<h4>Pair Programming Assignment</h4>

<p>These problems should be checked into your pair's SVN repository
by the due date.</p>

<p><strong>Project naming requirements</strong></p>
<p>The names of the projects and some of the project files must be
exactly the same as specified in the assignment. Failure to do so
makes it impossible for the graders to run your submission and results
in immediate <strong>loss of at least 50%</strong> of the homework
credit.</p>

<p>Every file you submit must have a header that identifies you and
the problem it solves. So, for the first problem the header should
look like this:</p>

<pre>
// Assignment 4 Problem 1
// Partner Name1
// partner1username
// Partner Name2
// partner2username
// 31 January 2012
</pre>


<h3>Problem 1</h3>

<P>Create a project with the name <tt>HW04Problem1</tt>.</p>

<p>You are trying to organize the file directories on your
computer. Your friend gave you a start by designing the data
definitions given in
the <tt><a href="FilesDirectories.java">FilesDirectories.java</a></tt>
file. She even gave you some examples of data. Import this file into
your project and run it to see what is going on.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make an additional example(s) of data that allows us to
  represent the following directory and its contents:</p>
  
<pre>
Directory Pages
  contains the following:
      file index.html
      file pictures.html
      directory Pictures
      directory Quotations
Directory Pictures
  contains the files:
      home.jpeg,
      friend.jpeg.
      brother.jpeg
Directory Quotations
  contains the files:
      twain.txt,
      cervantes.txt
</pre>
  
<p>Choose any sizes for these files. Assume the sizes are given in
  kiloBytes.</p></li>

<li><p>Design the method <tt>totalSize</tt> that computes the size of the
  directory by adding the sizes of all files in it. Additionally,
  every directory needs 4 kiloBytes for keeping track of its list of
  files and subdirectories.</p></li>

  
<li><p>Design the method <tt>allFiles</tt> that produces a list of all
  files of the given kind in the directory (and the names of all files
  in any of its subdirectories, sub-subdirectories...).</p>
  
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must include the templates for all
  classes in this problem, except the interfaces and classes that
  represent empty lists.</p>
  
<p><em>Note:</em> Use helper method where appropriate.</p></li>

</ol>

<h3>Problem 2</h3>

<P>Create a project with the name <tt>HW04Problem2</tt>. Your
<tt>java</tt> file must be named <tt>CartPt.java</tt> and the 
<em>Examples</em> class inside this file must be named
<tt>ExamplesCartPt</tt>.</p> 

<ol>
<li><p>Copy the following class into the file <em>CartPt.java</em>:

  <pre>
// to represent a location on the canvas
class Posn{
  int x;
  int y;

  Posn(int x, int y){
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
}
 </pre>

<p>Next week, this class will be a part of the library that supports the
  design of interactive games. That means, we cannot add anything to
  it, and if we need to add new behavior, we need to <em>extend</em>
  this class.</p></li>  


<li><p>Design the class <tt>CartPt</tt> that extends the library class
  <tt>Posn</tt>. We will not add any new fields, but by extending the
  library class we can add new methods to it.</p></li> 

<p>Design the following methods for the class <tt>CartPt</tt>:</p>

<li>Method <tt>distTo</tt> that computes the distance from this point
  to the given one.</p></li> 

<li><p>Method <tt>directionTo</tt> that produces a <tt>String</tt>
  that tells us in which direction do we have to travel from this
  point to the given one. Make sure you cover the following
  possibilities:</p> 

<p>going North, East, West, South, Northwest, Northeast, Southwest,
  and Southeast.</p> </li>  
</ol>

<h3>Problem 3</h3>

<p>Work out the last problem from Lab 4: <strong>Abstracting over data definitions:
Lifting fields, lifting methods.</strong>
