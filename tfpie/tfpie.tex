We propose a bridge between functional and object-oriented programming
in the first-year cirriculum.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Many universities and colleges aim to teach their students proficiency
in an industrial object-oriented programming language by the end of
their first year.  Past approaches to achieve this aim have included
teaching an industrial language, such as Java, starting on the first
day.  Others have taken a more indirect route by teaching functional
programming in the first semester, followed by a second semester that
starts in Java.  The latter approach is an improvement over the first,
but both suffer serious flaws.

As an example, Northeastern University teaches functional programming
in the first semester using \emph{How to Design Programs}
\cite{dvanhorn:Felleisen2001How}, followed by object-oriented
programming using \emph{How to Design Classes} \cite{local:htdc} in
the second semester.  This sequence is one 


These two courses are tightly integrated
and have been taught by the designers of this cirriculum.


We contribute an alternative approach to the second semester that
provides a gradual transition from functional programming to
object-oriented programming that culminates in industrial language
proficiency.

\cite{local:dpc}

Some of these are premature, and better introduced later in the
course.  Some are just irrelevant trivia (different syntax) that often
favors ``experienced'' students while needlessly intimidating students
with only the previous semester under their belt.  Many of these
trivial matters, e.g. Eclipse configuration, javac command line
arguments, the CLASSPATH, can be very frustrating to the uninitiated,
causing students to believe struggling with such crap is \emph{the
  essence of computer science}.  Bright, promising students may leave
the program, understandably so, in order to pursue more intellectually
fulfilling subjects.


\section{Background: the first semester}

At Northeastern, the College of Computer \& Information Science
requires a four course introductory sequence in the first year.  The
first semester features both a course on discrete mathematics as well
as an introduction to programming following the \emph{How to Design
  Programs} curriculum.  The second semester follows with a course on
object-oriented programming and one featuring formal reasoning about
programs, both on paper and with the ACL2 theorem prover.  

Subsequent to the first year, students take a wide variety of
follow-up courses, ranging from a required course in ``Object-oriented
design'' to architecture, operating systems, robotics, and programming
languages.  No standard language is used in these courses.  

More significantly, Northeastern distinctively emphasizes experiential
education, with almost all Computer Science majors participating in a
6 month ``co-op'' internship after their third semester.  These co-ops
take place at a wide variety of companies, and while most students do
some software development, there is almost no uniformity beyond that. 

This combination sets the constraints in which we designed our
approach.  Our students begin the course with a firm grasp of
data-driven program design, as well as experience with the tools used
in the first course:

\begin{itemize}
  \item the student languages introduced in \emph{How to Design
    Programs}~\cite{dvanhorn:Felleisen2004Structure,
    dvanhorn:Felleisen2001How} as well as the idea of ``language levels'';

  \item the DrRacket programming environment~\cite{dvanhorn:Findler2002DrScheme};

  \item the \texttt{check-expect} testing framework~\cite{local:check-expect};

  \item the ``World'' approach to developing interactive animations
    and games using functional
    programming~\cite{dvanhorn:Felleisen2009Functional}.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We reuses all of these elements in our approach.

After our course, our students should both (a) be prepared for
subsequent courses in the curriculum, which expect familiarity with
Java and standard Java libraries, (b) be prepared for co-ops in which
they will use industrial-strength languages and tools which will
almost certainly be object-oriented.  More significantly, we aim to
teach the key insights behind the object-oriented approach to program
design.

\section{A small shift of focus}

The semester starts with the minimal conceptual change from the
previous semester: the addition of objects (same IDE, same syntax,
same semantics [just a new kind of value], same interactive video
games, etc.).

\subsection{Side-by-side example of program design}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Lists of numbers
\item World

\section{From principles to industrial languages}

Could work with any fashion, and should really lead into many
fashionable languages.  The purpose of showing many is to demonstrate
that the same principles apply in each setting.  Each language can also
expose students to various mechanisms.

\subsection{Java}

\begin{itemize}
\item Types
\item Compiler
\item ``Industrial'' features (collections library, ...)
\end{itemize}



\section{Our course}

\subsection{Representation-independence and interface-oriented programming}

\subsection{Distributed, Interactive Programs}

\subsection{Unifying functions and objects}

The noble goals of ProfJ:

\begin{itemize}
\item language levels
\item continuity in IDE from first semester
\end{itemize}

Many of the shortcomings of HtDC and ProfJ are ``day 1'' problems.
The transition is too abrupt and too large.

The failures of  ProfJ:

\begin{itemize}
\item dead.
\item changes languages from first semester rather than adding new
  concept (causes students confusing deep issue (O.O. design) and
  shallow ones (Java-like syntax) and orthogonal issues (static type
  discipline).  (This also ultimately lead to the tool being abandoned
  as it was too difficult to maintain.)

\item commits to a particular fashion rather than enabling any.

\item abandons the first semester approach and replaces it with a
  (completely) object-oriented approach on day one.  There are
  analogies between functional and object concepts (``a method is like
  a function''), but the two never co-exist in a program.

\item Java, even pared down pedagoical Java, is syntactically heavy; discourages
  interactive programming

\end{itemize}

The changes that occur on Day 1 of HtDC w/ ProfJ:

\begin{itemize}
\item Radically different syntax
\item Types
\item Total committment to objects
\item Subtly different base values
\end{itemize}

The changes that occur on Day 1 of HtDC w/o ProfJ:

\begin{itemize}
\item Different IDE
\item Compilation
\item Loss of interactivity
\end{itemize}

\section{Experience and outlook}

Perspective into the upper-class cirriculum:

\begin{itemize}
\item types, contract, invariants : formal methods, program verification,
  
\item representation independence : component-based software engineering,
  data-structures, algorithms

\item interfaces, interactions, distribution : operating systems, networking
\end{itemize}


Other steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item types in class language
\item pedagogical Java environment
\item ugly syntax for class language
\item world in Java
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Acknowledgements}

Matthias Felleisen's approach to pedagody and passion for
undergraduate teaching has inspired this work from the beginning.
CCIS Dean Larry Finkelstein allowed two postdocs to redesign a key
undergraduate course.  Our teaching assistants, Dan Brown, Asumu
Takikawa, and Nicholas Labich, as well as the tutors and graders,
contributed enormously to the success of our courses. Finally, and
most importantly, our students at Northeastern for the last three
years have put up with a curriculum in progress, and the opportunity
to teach them has been truly rewarding.
